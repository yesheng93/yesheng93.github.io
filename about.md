After was born and raised in Nanjing for 18 years, I came to US for college education. I studied CS and Maths here and then became a software enginner. Currently, I am working on django web development at drchrono in Sunnyvale, CA. 

This blog was built with jekyll(a static site generator) and hosted on github. The goal of this blog is to keep notes about my projects and thoughts. Since I am a native Chinese speaker. Some/Most of the posts would be in Chinese. Since I am not really a ruby programmer, my another interest here is to have my own static site generator written in python.
